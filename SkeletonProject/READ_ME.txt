Assignment: Assignment 4 - Normal Mapping & Environment Reflection
Project name: SkeletonProject
Authors: Jesse Mckinley & Abner Herrera

The following inputs are implemented:
	- "E" key toggles a higher blending between the diffuse and the environment 	   reflection
	- "W" key Toggles between Solid render & Wireframe render
	- "O" key changes the Object to view
	- "T" key toggles textures on/off
	- "R" key toggles the Environment Reflection on/off
	- "N" key toggles the Normal Mapping on/off
	- +/- keys increment/decrement the blend between the specular of the material 	   and the reflection
	- A/S keys increment/decrement the strength of the Normals
	- 1..7 keys set the specular coeffiecient to different values
	- Mouse movement: 
		* Mouse Wheel zooms in/out
		* Moving mouse horizontally & vertically rotates camera accordingly


Notes:
* All shapes are made with a WHITE material.

* All Shaders use a Point Light to recieve light from.

* World Lighting Components:
	- Diffuse is a RED color
	- Ambient is a BLUE color
	- Specular is a RED color
